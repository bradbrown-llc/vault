# Orbicular
An experimental shitcoin. Specifically inspired by AntiAmple and Ampleforth, and an experiment to see if rebases generated market activity by seeing what happens if one was to cyclically rebase forever.

Also contains V2 contracts, the beginnings of a prediction market platform, and AZIZ and ARSU, an extension to the Orbicular experiment: what if we had two tokens with cyclical rebases with an inverted schedule. One could then 'hop' from token to token riding an infinite inflation curve, despite neither token having permanent inflation.
