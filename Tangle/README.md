> ⚠️ **SUNDOWN** - This repo will become deprecated soon. The original Diamond Contract EIP was used to create the Tangle token, but I believe that EIP is very bloated. Additionally, Tangle has been through enough versions already, and birthed the concept of the upgradeable shitcoin.

# Tangle
The upgradeable shitcoin. Notably, this repository contains ADISA, a novel data structure that can be used to offset storage space from storage-expensive environments (like the EVM) to less storage-expensive environments at very little cost, albeit with much increased complexity.
