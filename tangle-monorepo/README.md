A massive amount of progress since Orbicular, but there are too many changes that need to be made. A rewrite is necessary.

# Tangle
The Tangle Cryptocurrency Ecosystem

This monorepo consists of many prior things, including web-ui frontends for various projects using various frameworks, smart contracts, media, ideas, diagrams, setup and configuration info, scripts, logs, libraries, web applications, etc.

Below is a list of some of what is found in here and a brief summary:
- 2021_09_20_frontend_archive (TNGL) - An archive of the website frontend for TNGL and Meta using the Vue framework.
- fractal - An idea to use a distinct PoW chain as a consenus mechanism, but then take that chain and simulate the bare minimum of it using smart contracts on existing chains. Within here is also a novel de Bruijn number generator for numbers 2^N of arbitrary N, tools to start and stop a local chain for testing, and parts of a Vue frontend.
- media - Media like ads, gifs, and images for TNGL.
- Meta - An NFT contract that allows one to 'mint' addresses, with NFTs containing an image link hardcoded to the trustwallet github (large repository of token logs). The idea was that you could claim ownership of an 'address' (not really) and also to turn all of trustwallets many official token logos into NFTs.
- xdex - A centralized cross-chain bridge and exchange system.
- Tangle - A state-of-the-art, upgradeable shitcoin. contains **many** smart contracts, novel web3 library chunks, a web application, Vue components for a frontend, some media, transfer logs for most of the pre-Tangle ecosystem and scripts to obtain those logs (used for conversion), and a large amount of xdex files.
- utils - A (probably defunct) script to automate the acquisition of /biz/ ad bid data to determine good ad bid prices.
