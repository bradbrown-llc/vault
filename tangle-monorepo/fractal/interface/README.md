Instructions on recreating interface:

1. Go to https://download-directory.github.io/
2. Paste the GitHub folder URL https://github.com/TangleSpider/tangle-monorepo/tree/master/fractal/interface
3. Press Enter
4. download-directory.github.io should download the contents of the fractal interface into a zip file
5. Unzip the contents of this into a folder
6. Navigate to that folder in a command prompt or terminal
7. Run the command `npm run dev` in that folder (this requires Node.js to be installed, get it from https://nodejs.org/en/)
8. This should give an output similar to
` vite v2.8.6 dev server running at:
  \> Local: http://localhost:3000/`
9. Navigate to that URL (http://localhost:3000/) in a web browser to open the interface
NOTE: This has only been tested on desktop, using the Brave browser (should work with any Chrome-based browser), using the Metamask mobile crypto wallet. Issues can be directed to @TangleSpider at https://t.me/TangleCoin.
