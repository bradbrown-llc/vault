bytecode for an ERC20 pact
here's a thought
instead of the "diamond" pattern, which i always thought was a bit of a pain in the ass and unintuitive:
"store all storage vars in a struct in a library and library has a function that returns the struct with a modified storage slot"
make the pact as normal
make a utility simply update the bytecode so that every SSTORE and SSLOAD is offset, but inserting an ADD and a PUSH/OFFSET
