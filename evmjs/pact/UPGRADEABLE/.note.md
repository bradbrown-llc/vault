			      pact upgradeable
an upgradeable pact
has an owner, facets
owner is an address
facets are a mapping of function selectors to addresses
upgradeable delegates most calls to its facet addresses
owner can change facet addresses and owner
a retained call is processed by this pact, and is one of either CHGOWN or SETFACET
CHGOWN changes ownership of the pact
SETFACET changes the address of a facet

diamond pact creator reverts if facet address is 0, although i don't think that's necessary
it would only save gas if invalid calls were made to the pact, and consume more gas if valid calls were made to the pact
which, to me, seems to be a bit retarded
it could be a safety mechanism, if address 0 ever had a pact deployed to it
however, if someone could deploy pacts to arbitrary addresses, this pact will be insignificant amidst the chaos of that possibility

decided against the retsignal, we'll just have to make sure that when we add selectors they don't collide
although if they do collide, the owner verification should stop anything bad from happening

so without it, how do we determine delegate vs retain?
selector is either equal to the the selector for CHGOWN, maybe just 0x00000000, or it isn't
if it is, jump to verification
else proceed with delegation

new thought, don't even check the selector, check the first byte, everything besides ERC20 will be nonstandard, so as long as the first byte doesn't match any of the ERC20 selector first bytes, we're good
so check if first byte of calldata is 00
if it is, then retain, else delegate
complexity cost of checking first byte vs stored retsignal should be covered by not pushing 31 other bytes or by not loading from storage
wait that's not true, PUSH32 has the same cost as PUSH1
FUCK
so

...

use rsig, but hardcode it? saves gas because we don't have to shift to get the selector?
would make the retain calls more expensive, but the delegate call cheaper (retain many times more expensive than delegate cheaper, but wahey)

rsig is now harcoded as all zeroes, really cheap and easy to check, there's even PUSH0 which pushes a zero, or even ISZERO to check against zero
owner is in slot 0
we'll make SETFACET revert if selector is 0
that we we never accidentally overwrite the owner slot while setting a facet

make:
need to set the owner to the caller on deployment
need to end by returning run code

run:
need to determine if call is to be delegated or retained check first word of calldata to see if it eq
if delegate call, delegate the call
if delegate call fails, revert with returndata from delegate call
if delegate call succeeds, return with returndata from delegate call
if retained call, verify caller is owner, then, jump to PC indicated by calldata
CHGOWN should change the owner to the address supplied by calldata
SETFACET should change the facet address at the slot specified by the selector, both supplied by calldata
